= Introduction =
The MiniAssistant is a small widget, which can be embbeded 
within your application to provide a similar experience
as the full bloat Qt4-Assitant, with some constrains.


This is a stand alone dockable widget which is completely
self contained, and has constructed mainly of a tab widget which
separates the GUI to the index tab and the Mini-Browser.

The Mini Assistant has the following features:
 * Can load DCF files used by Qt4 documentation
 * Can display the Qt4 documentation 
 * Can display a list of references available in the loaded DCF file
 * Can filter the list of pages "on the fly"
 * The Mini Browser has a "URL" edit for quick acess to pages, which supports completion
 * Tracks the history of visited help pages, and lists them as popular pages
 * Can scan a QTextEdit a give suggestions to help pages
 * Uses the model view controller support provided by Qt4
 * All internal classes are contained in an MiniAssistantInt internal namespace
