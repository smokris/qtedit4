The mini-assistant is a small widget, which can be embbeded 
within your application to provide a similar experience
as the full bloat Qt4-Assitant, with some constrains.


This is a stand alone dockable widget which is completely
self contained, and has constructed mainly of a tab widget which
separates the GUI to the index tab and the Mini-Browser.

The Mini Assistant has the following features:
 - Can load DCF files used by Qt4 documentation
 - Can display the Qt4 documentation 
 - Can display a list of references available in the loaded DCF file
 - Can filter the list of pages "on the fly"
 - The Mini Browser has a "URL" edit for quick acess to pages, which supports completion
 - Tracks the history of visited help pages, and lists them as popular pages
 - Can scan a QTextEdit a give suggestions to help pages
 - Uses the model view controller support provided by Qt4
 - All internal classes are contained in an MiniAssistantInt internal namespace 

The code is fully documented, and HTML documentation is available in the doc/html directory.
